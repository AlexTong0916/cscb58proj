The final version that was demonstrated is blackjack.v

It incorporates the modules contained in hex_decoders.v and draw_card.v, meaning those files are unneeded and therefore are in the Unused Files folder.

An alternate version of the project, cardgame_21 is also in Unused Files. It is meant to be a simpler version, but it does not work.
